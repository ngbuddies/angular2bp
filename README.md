# Newproject

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.19-3.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Deploying to Github Pages

Run `ng github-pages:deploy` to deploy to Github Pages.

## Further help

To get more help on the `angular-cli` use `ng --help` or go check out the [Angular-CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).

## node version

install latest version of node check current version of node by 'node -v' and > 6.0 is good with angular2

## npm version

install latest version of npm check current version of node by 'npm -v' and > 3.0 is good with angular2

## run application on any port

By default project will run on localhost:4200 and if you want to change default port there is two way

1) run this command ng serve --port xxxx
2) add .ember-cli file in root directory and set json object like ;{port:3001}


When you're ready to push your app into production, just run the compile command:

$ ng build

This will concatenate and minify your sources and place them by default into the dist/ directory. There will only be some files: jss,htnl,css,assets(font,css). If you use any assets (src/assets/) then they will be copied to dist/ as is.


This is a project that is not broad in scope, so there's not really much of a wish list here. But I would like to see a couple of things:

I'd like it to be a little simpler. I want this to be a universal starting point. If someone is starting a new Angular2 project, she should be able to clone, merge, or download its source and immediately start doing what she needs without renaming a bunch of files and methods or deleting spare parts. What I have works for a first release, but I just think there is a little too much here right now.

Naturally, I am open to all manner of ideas and suggestions. See the "Contributing" section below.
